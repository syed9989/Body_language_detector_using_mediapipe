This project is focused on body language detection using MediaPipe and OpenCV to capture, analyze, and interpret human body movements. The system leverages MediaPipeâ€™s robust pose detection models to track key body landmarks, such as hands, face, and torso, in real-time from video input, making it suitable for applications in fitness tracking, gesture recognition, and human-computer interaction.
